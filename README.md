# Convolutional Neural Network for Face Recognition & Verification

This an individual class assignment implementing a CNN model for facial recognition and verification. The assignment deliverables are as follows:

Solve an image-based face classification problem using a CNN.

* Set up the CNN
* Learn to handle image data
* Use augmentation techniques for images
* Train the model
* Optimize the model
* Explore architectures and hyperparameters for the optimal solution
* Track losses and performance on validation data to ensure the code is working
properly and the model is being trained properly
* Solve issues of data loading, memory usage, arithmetic precision etc. to
maximize the time efficiency of your training and inference.
